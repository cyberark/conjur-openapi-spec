The Conjur OpenAPI Specification describes endpoints in the Conjur API via the industry-standard  
OpenAPI v3. The specification can be used to auto-generate client code and documentation to  
streamline development processes.

Find [more from CyberArk](https://github.com/cyberark).

## Requirements

This project requires Docker and access to DockerHub.

The OpenAPI Specification is compatible with [Conjur OSS v1.9+](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur).  
Clients are generated using [OpenAPI Generator v4.3.1](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/v4.3.1).

## Getting Started

To generate a client library using the OpenAPI spec, use the provided script:

```shell
$ ./bin/generate_client <language>
```

The script with generate a Python client in the absence of a `<language>` argument.  
A full list of supported languages can be found in [OpenAPI Generator documentation](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#overview).
