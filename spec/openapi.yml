    get:
      tags:

      summary: "Get role information"
      description: "Gets detailed information about a specific role, including the role members.


        If a role A is granted to a role B, then role A is said to have role B as a member. These relationships are described in the “members” portion of the returned JSON.


        ##### Listing members


        If `members` is provided, you will get the members of a role.


        If a `kind` query parameter is given, narrows results to only resources of that kind.


        If a `limit` is given, returns no more than that number of results. Providing an `offset` skips a number of resources before returning the rest. In addition, providing an `offset` will give limit a default value of 10 if none other is provided. These two parameters can be combined to page through results.


        If the parameter `count` is true, returns only the number of items in the list.


        ##### Text search


        If the search parameter is provided, narrows results to those pertaining to the search query. Search works across resource IDs and the values of annotations. It weights results so that those with matching id or a matching value of an annotation called name appear first, then those with another matching annotation value, and finally those with a matching kind.
